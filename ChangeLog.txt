================================

[1] Further FreeBSD build tweaks (no longer necessary to specify --host
when configuring on a 64-bit system)

include file can always be found in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/include, the 32-bit
static libraries can always be found in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib32, and the
64-bit static libraries can always be found in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib64.

programs (cjpeg, etc.) and man pages.

with PIC code.
